# Session 3: Mastering the Art of Crafting a SLR

## What You Need to Do Before Joining this class üöÄ

### 1. Obsidian Plugins
Obsidian is a powerful note-taking app that allows you to create and link your notes in various ways. To enhance your note-taking experience, you can use plugins that add extra features and functionalities to Obsidian. The plugins used in this vault are as follows:

| No. | Plugins | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Charts](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition) | A plugin that allows you to create block-styled admonitions (notes, warnings, tips, etc.) in your notes. |
| 2 | [Chartview](https://github.com/yeboster/autocomplete-obsidian) | A plugin that provides autocomplete suggestions for words, tags, links, and commands in your notes. |
| 3 | [Pandoc Plugin](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count) | A plugin that shows the word count, character count, and reading time of your notes in the status bar. |
| 4 | [Pandoc Reference List](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) | A plugin that adds a calendar view to your notes, where you can see and create notes based on dates. |


These plugins can help you make your notes more organized, informative, and creative. You can install them from the Obsidian community plugins page or from their GitHub repositories.
